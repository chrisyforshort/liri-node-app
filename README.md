# liri-node-app

Liri is a node basd application that takes in commands and gives you results. Liri uses JQuery, Node, Spotify API, OMDB API, and Twitter API. There is also a text file that logs all searches/commands.

## Instructions 
After starting node, you may type 4 commands:
    (1) "my-tweets" - This will return all the tweets from my Twitter "ChrisyForShort". The tweets include when the tweet was created and the tweet itself.
    (2) "spotify-this-song" - If you type this command with a song title after, it will return the artist, album, and spotify link to the song. If you do not include a song after the command it will search the default song, The Sign Ace of Base.
    (3) "movie-this" - If you type this command with a movie title after, it will return that movie's plot, rotten tomato rating, year of release, language, country of release, actors, and IMDB rating. If you do not specify a movie, it will search the default movie Mr. Nobody. 
    (4) "do-what-it-says" - Will read my random text for a surprise action!
